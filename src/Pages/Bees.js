                    Honey bees, beekeepers and the honey industry are direct
                    contributors to the success of American agriculture. Today,
                    the honey industry faces many challenges, such as hive loss,
                    drought, colony collapse and shrinking forage areas. Here
                    are a few ways you can help the honey bees: Plant
                    bee-friendly flowers and flowering herbs in your garden and
                    yard. Reduce or limit the use of chemicals and pesticides to
                    treat your lawn or garden while plants are in bloom. Bees
                    are thirsty. Put a shallow basin of fresh water with marbles
                    or rocks in it for the bees to land on outside your home.
